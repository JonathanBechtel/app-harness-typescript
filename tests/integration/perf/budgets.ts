/**
 * Per-route query-count budgets.
 *
 * THE BUMP-THE-NUMBER PROTOCOL: a failing budget means your change added
 * queries to that route. Accidental N+1 or serial waterfall -> fix it (batch the
 * load, join, parallelise independent awaits); do not raise the budget.
 * A deliberate, necessary new query -> raise the budget here, in the same diff,
 * so the added per-request cost is visible in review. If a refactor LOWERS a
 * count, lower the budget too so the win is locked in.
 *
 * Origin: a homepage that shipped a 25-query serial waterfall where every query
 * took <3ms. The cost was the count, not the SQL. Counting is what catches it.
